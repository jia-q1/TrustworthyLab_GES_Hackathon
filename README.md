# Overview 

To run our virtual machine and implement our model, you can either directly access it by putting the key into the decryption python script, or run the attestation checksum as shown in the video here:

Afterwards, set up the filepath correctly by grabbing the decrypted datasets and putting them in the train folder. 

Then run the data_analysis.py file via `python data_analysis.py` and showcase the statistical graphs

The results and statistics will be printed in a text file as well as show up in the terminal in which `python data_analysis.py` was run in
